webflow disadvantages

1. Not enough components
2. No easy way of copying items between projects
3. No use of Master page.
4. the actual tools for building forms in Webflow are terrific
5. Webflow copy-paste is unique “crazy” feature (hard to find this feature on another tools). Open two projects on two browsers tabs - copy - paste. This is not limitation.
6. plenty of “no native clipboard data” errors that are fixed after copying again
7. keyboard shortcuts are a perpetual hit-and-miss (click the panels first…)
8. page interactions can’t be copied
9. multiple divs cannot be selected
10. frustratingly slow lag on longer pages & more complex divs
11. the Asset Manager is an anarchic mess and useless "manager": there are no folders :exploding_head:, you cannot multi-select images :exploding_head:, you cannot replace images throughout the site :exploding_head:, you cannot rename images, and you cannot reorder images once they’ve been uploaded
12. Responsive images are half-baked: no support for object-position still and background images are not responsively resized
13. Page interactions underscore that Webflow was kind of designed for landing pages: page interactions are not activated between separate pages :exploding_head: and page interactions cannot be copy pasted :exploding_head:
14. Interactions overall have a high friction: no way to organize interactions :exploding_head: and an absurd amount of clicks are needed just to assign an interaction :exploding_head:
15. Symbols, oh, symbols are also half-baked: interactions cannot be set on symbols :exploding_head: , symbols cannot be nested :exploding_head: (kill me now, multilingual), and symbols are extremely rigid that every pixel must be identical (though this is “apparently” getting fixed soon)
16. Webflow forms cannot feed into the Webflow CMS (why would anyone ever want to submit organized data into Webflow’s CMS?)
17. hard agree on multilingual, which again falls into the “landing page web designer moving into full-fledged website” theme you’ll see throughout Webflow
18. the hosting is heavily biased towards US/European users: the only way to get images (the bulk of your bandwidth) on more than HK & SGP Asia-based CDNs requires the costliest package.
19. the bugs, oh, the bugs. There are many little bugs hiding in every corner of Webflow. SVG rendering issues, interaction bugs, Designer crashing bugs, font-loading degradation, etc. I work 8+ hours a day in Webflow and, golly, does that give you some insight!

20. This honestly may be something I haven't figured out yet, but I don't think you can use animations within CMS pages.
